    <h3>Login</h3>
        <p>Using https://city-guide-api-3d2f74a4c59e.herokuapp.com/login will authenticate the user and return a JSON object listing all the user data and their issued JWT to access the rest of the site. The query requires a username and password as parameters. For example, https://city-guide-api-3d2f74a4c59e.herokuapp.com/login?Username=example&Password=example</p>
    <h3>Allow new users to register</h3>
        <p>Using https://city-guide-api-3d2f74a4c59e.herokuapp.com/users with the POST method will return a JSON object showing the new user's information (as well as an automated ID). The request body must be a JSON object in the following format: 
            <code>{
                "Username": String,
                "Password": String,
                "Email": String
            }</code>. The query requires no parameter. Entering a valid JSON object in the request body will return the JSON response object. An example of a valid entry is: 
            <code>{
              "Username": "example",
              "Password": "example",
              "Email": "example@email.com"

          <code>{
            Username: String,
            (required)
            Password: String,
            (required)
            Email: String,
            (required)
          }</code>. 
          For example, https://city-guide-api-3d2f74a4c59e.herokuapp.com/users/64c2a4ec799ddbb40e98a73f/ would have a request body as follows: 
          <code>{
            "Username": "example1",
            "Password": "example",
            "Email": "example@email.com"
